# [KPhysics](https://kphysics.github.io/KPhysics/) (based on [JPhysics](https://github.com/HaydenMarshalla/JPhysics))
KPhysics is an improved and extended version of Hayden Marshalla's JPhysics. It is a 2D physics engine with zero third-party dependencies.

It is written in Kotlin and is intended to be easily used in games programmed with Kotlin or Java.
